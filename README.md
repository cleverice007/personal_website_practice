# personal_website_practice
This is my first attempt at practicing HTML and CSS by mimicking the format of a website. The website I referenced has a mobile version,
 but for now, I am only using media queries to practice responsive web design. 
The style does not yet conform to the mobile version, and my short-term goal is to prevent any layout issues while zooming.
I also created an app using Express, and plan to add more features in the future, such as connecting the "contact me" form to Gmail.
